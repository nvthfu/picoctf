And i focus on 

```
You can use your name as a log in, because that's quick and easy to remember! If you don't 
like your name, use a short and cool one like John! 
```

may be it's mention `John The Ripper`, let's crack it with common dictionary

get jwt after login as `user` and save it `jwt.txt`, using command `john jwt.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=HMAC-SHA256`

and got `ilovepico` is secret key

go to `jwt.io` and check this secret key

It's ok

Go create new `jwt` with [script](pyjwt.py) (if no module jwt, just uninstall `JWT` and `PyJWT` and re-install `PyJWT`)
